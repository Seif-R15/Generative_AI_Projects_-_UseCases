In this lab, we've initially set <code>max_articles_num</code> to 500 for speedier results, allowing you to observe the outcomes faster. Once you've done an initial run, consider increasing this value to 750 or 1,000. You'll likely notice that the context provided to the LLM becomes richer and better. You can experiment by gradually raising this variable for different queries to observe the improvements in the LLM's contextual understanding.</p>"

He flourished under Al-Ma'moun in Baghdad, Iraq through 813-833 AD, and died around 840 AD. The book was brought into Europe and translated into Latin in the 12th century. The book was then given the name 'Algebra'. (The ending of the mathematician's name, al-Khwarizmi, was changed into a word easier to say in Latin, and became the English word algorithm).\n",

Computers work through the program by using a central processing unit, and they use fast memory called RAM (also known as Random Access Memory) as a space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this.

            "Algorithms are a specific set of instructions or steps on how to complete a task. For example, a computer scientist wants to sort playing cards. There are many ways to sort them - by suits (diamonds, clubs, hearts, and spades) or by numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace).  By deciding on a set of steps to sort the cards, the scientist has created an algorithm. The scientist then needs to test whether this algorithm works. This shows how well and how fast the algorithm sorts cards.\n",

            "Early forms of algebra were developed by the Babylonians and the Greek geometers such as Hero of Alexandria. However the word \"algebra\" is a Latin form of the Arabic word Al-Jabr (\"casting\") and comes from a mathematics book Al-Maqala fi Hisab-al Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah, (\"Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation\") written in the 9th century by a Persian mathematician, Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, who was a Muslim born in Khwarizm in Uzbekistan. He flourished under Al-Ma'moun in Baghdad, Iraq through 813-833 AD, and died around 840 AD. The book was brought into Europe and translated into Latin in the 12th century. The book was then given the name 'Algebra'. (The ending of the mathematician's name, al-Khwarizmi, was changed into a word easier to say in Latin, and became the English word algorithm).\n",
